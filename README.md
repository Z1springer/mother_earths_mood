This assignment was key to flexing out the fingers for jQuery, and just how much it interacts with the webpage. It also opened up the world of using API's in the work we do. Within this paprticular example is the use of the openweathermap API. We were tasked with creating a weather forecaster, and designing it as such so it would show the current weather and date, as well as a forecast of at least 5 days. Looking at the webpage we can see that there are cards ready and waiting to show the information that we are looking for. Typing in a city name will then grab the information from the API's, as well as a corresponding weather icon. We can then see displayed on the main card the current; temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. Within the smaller blue cards we can then see a five day forecast following the current date, showing the dates, corresponding weather icons, temperature, and humidity. We can search up multiple cities if we like as well, all our previous searches will be saved to our local storage for referance should we need them, we just need to select the previous city from the search history and that city will then display its own information.
